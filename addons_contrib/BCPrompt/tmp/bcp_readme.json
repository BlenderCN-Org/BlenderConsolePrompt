We can use the console to execute commands, instead of key-combos. Sometimes we run out of sane key combos or find that they get complex. At the moment only one-shot commands are implemented, but future implementations will be modal/interactive and possibly a bpm (Blender package manager).\n\nthese are the non modal, one shot commands\n\nCommand String | Description\n-------------- | -------------\ncen | centers 3d cursor\ncen=some_value | where some value can be evalled, 3d cursor will be placed at it\nvtx | sees if tinyCAD is enabled and performs VTX, (or first enables it)\nxl (XL) | sees if tinyCAD is enabled and performs XALL, (or first enables it)\nico | sees if developers icons addon is enabled (enables if not) [image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/619340/5883599/368909cc-a354-11e4-9a8e-f442ebb8621e.gif)\nwipe | un-links and removes objects, and all meshes\ntt | turntable\ntb | trackball\nsyntax | sets text editor to syntax highlighting, wrap, linenumber, margin\nstring! | anything followed by an exclamation mark is copied to buffer\nstring?se | search blender.stackexchange for everything infront of the ?\nstring??se | search stackoverflow for everything infront of the ??\nstring?py | search py docs ..\nstring?bpy | search blender bpy docs ..\n_svc | checking recent sverchok commits (github api) [image](https://github.com/zeffii/BlenderConsolePrompt/issues/3#issuecomment-74256330)\n-gist -o somename | uploads all visible text blocks as a unified github anonymous public gist, then it will open the url in a browser. `-gist -o somename`\n-sel somename | is select=True for all data.objects where `.name.startswith(somename)`\n-man | opens github readme.md for the addon\ntimes treename | treename must be a valid Sverchok Tree name, will spawn a browser with visualization.
