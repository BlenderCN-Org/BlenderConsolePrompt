design considerations

from past experience this should not totally flatten the existing install,
rather it it should copy the content (minus folders..2.7x etc) into a
new archive. So in the event of 'catastrophic' failure I can revert.

Further caution taken with regards to any symlinked folders which may exist.
For me inside addons and addons_contrib i have several such folders which
link to local git repository of addons in development.

I think the process should be
- locate download zip (After narrow down)
- start external python thread
- tell it where the current .exe is
- close blender
- zip all files in the executable folder
- read whitelist of addons to remove from the download zip before copy
in my case
    - addons/sverchok
    - addons_contrib/BioBlender
    - addons_contrib/tinyCAD
    - addons_contrib/BCPrompt
    - any more?
- remove all whitelisted folders from the download.zip
- unpack download.zip into correct place
- start blender
- end longrunning python thread
